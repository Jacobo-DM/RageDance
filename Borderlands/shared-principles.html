  <h2>Shared Principles: The Borderlands</h2>

  <p>
    DiscoveryMode and RageDance share a border – a living membrane where ideas can travel 
    without the two practices becoming the same thing. At this border, one principle moves 
    freely between them:
    <strong>pulse</strong> – our way of paying attention to breath, timing, and presence.
  </p>

  <h3>What Travels Across the Border</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Noticing our own pulse and the pulse of the room.</li>
    <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> Asking “What is happening here?” instead of “What is wrong?”</li>
    <li><strong>Nonverbal Listening:</strong> Reading posture, pace, and energy without judgment.</li>
    <li><strong>Choice:</strong> Recognizing that we can step closer, step back, or pause.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What Stays in RageDance</h3>
  <p>
    RageDance is a separate discipline. It does <em>not</em> live inside DiscoveryMode.
    It carries responsibilities that are not appropriate for a general classroom:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Defensive movement and boundary-setting in high-stress situations.</li>
    <li>Trauma-aware practice that must be handled with care and consent.</li>
    <li>Lineage, ethics, and commitments that belong to a dedicated practice space.</li>
    <li>Real-world threat modeling and scenario work.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Because of this, RageDance is never “taught” in DiscoveryMode. 
    Only shared principles of pulse and awareness are adapted for safe, everyday use.
  </p>

  <h3>What Stays in DiscoveryMode</h3>
  <p>
    DiscoveryMode uses pulse for learning, not for combat or self-defense. In DM, pulse supports:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Classroom readiness and settling after transitions.</li>
    <li>Group activities like the <strong>Pulse Circle</strong> and other movement games.</li>
    <li>Social-emotional learning: “How do we affect each other’s space and focus?”</li>
    <li>Community building through rhythm, play, and shared attention.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why This Border Matters</h3>
  <p>
    Keeping a clear border protects both practices:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>RageDance</strong> remains a focused discipline with clear ethics and boundaries.</li>
    <li><strong>DiscoveryMode</strong> remains a safe, playful environment for students and teachers.</li>
    <li>Educators can borrow the <em>principle</em> of pulse without carrying the weight of the lineage.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You can think of it like this:
    <br>
    <strong>RageDance is the forge.</strong><br>
    <strong>DiscoveryMode is the playground.</strong><br>
    The hoop is completed where they touch – in shared attention, shared rhythm, and shared care for the people in the circle.
