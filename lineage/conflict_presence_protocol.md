# Conflict & Presence Protocol  
**Domain:** Project 6 — RageDance  
**Audience:** Instructors, advanced practitioners  
**Purpose:** Prevent escalation. Maintain dignity. Discourage harm.  
**Signature:** Witness | Firegate | Stillness

## Two Stances

### 1. Ego-Intimidation (Forbidden)
- inflates the self  
- invites escalation  
- uses fire outwardly  
- destabilizes the room  
- trains dominance, not protection  

This corrupts the lineage.

### 2. Guardianship Presence (Permitted / Necessary)
- breath settles downward  
- spine lengthens  
- weight drops into the floor  
- heat remains internal  
- energy communicates:  
  **“I will not harm you, but I will not let you harm me or others.”**

This de-escalates without retreating.  
This is a mature expression of the Witness stance.

## Core Reminder
**RageDance teaches power.  
RageDance forbids dominance.**
