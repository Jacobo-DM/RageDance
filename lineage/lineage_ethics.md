## Boundary 5 — Presence Without Harm
RageDance never weaponizes presence.  
However, presence may be used to prevent harm.

Some situations require a stance that discourages violence without inviting it.  
To stand firm without rising in heat is not intimidation.  
**It is guardianship.**

This boundary is non-negotiable.
