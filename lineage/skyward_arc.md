Skyward Arc
RageDance Lineage Movement
Essence
A rising, breath-guided arc that opens the entire right side of the body.
Skyward Arc is not a strike — it is a declaration of presence.
It lengthens the line from the grounded foot through the ribs, shoulder, and elbow into a single upward flow.
This movement calms the internal fire, restores breath, and establishes space without threat.
Starting Position
Left foot forward, right foot back
Guard relaxed and present
Torso naturally twisted to the left
Breath low and open
The Movement
Step the right foot forward (still grounded on the mat).
Maintain left-hand guard — not defensive, simply aware.
Let the right elbow rise in a long ascending arc.
The line originates from above the right knee.
The stretch travels up through the ribs, flank, shoulder, and elbow.
Allow the arc to reach its natural height — no forcing, no compression.
At the apex, pause just long enough for breath to catch the opening.
Return to center with ease.
Purpose
Lengthen and open the lateral body line
Create space around the practitioner without intimidation
Soften internal heat, disperse compressed emotion
Invite upward breath and grounded presence
Reset the pulse before the next movement
Safety Notes
Keep shoulder soft; avoid locking the joint
The arc should never strain the neck
Follow the breath, not the impulse to “reach farther”
The movement is gentle by design — speed is optional and never required
Pulse Notes
Skyward Arc is a non-aggressive expansion.
It tells the body and the space around you:
I am here.
I am aware.
I am present, not threatening.
Performed slowly, it becomes a stretch.
Performed medium, it becomes a boundary-setting gesture.
Performed quickly, it becomes a release of upward tension — but never a strike.
Variations
Slow Arc: breath-synchronized, deep stretch
Pulse Arc: medium tempo, used to restore rhythm
Wind Arc: quick, short arc for rapid release without force
Balance Notes
Skyward Arc is always practiced on both sides unless there is pain,
injury, or need for rest. Each upward arc should be paired with a
downward or grounding movement to restore neutrality and prevent
overextension. Balance keeps the pulse clear.
