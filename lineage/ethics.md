RageDance Ethics
First Principles of the Lineage
RageDance is not a fighting system.
It is a way of listening, reclaiming space, and moving with heat without causing harm.
These principles are the foundation of all practice:
⭐ 1. No posturing. No intimidation.
Movements may appear strong, sharp, or sudden,
but the intention is never to dominate or threaten.
Presence is not the same as aggression.
⭐ 2. RageDance begins in feeling, not performance.
Every form starts from sensation — breath, pulse, heat, grounding.
There is no “correct look,” only honest awareness.
⭐ 3. Safety is non-negotiable.
Your safety, others’ safety, and the safety of the environment
are always prioritized over expression or technique.
⭐ 4. No hierarchy of bodies.
Elders, children, disabled practitioners, beginners, and experts
all practice within the same circle.
Movements adapt to the person, not the other way around.
⭐ 5. The grid is a tool, not a rule.
Practice surfaces (like the jute mat cells) help with orientation and teaching,
but they never override intuition or comfort.
⭐ 6. Movements are invitations, not commandments.
Every form may be slowed, softened, shortened, or reinterpreted.
The body leads; the lineage listens.
⭐ 7. No one practices alone in their suffering.
RageDance honors the truth that strong emotion is not a flaw
but a signal — a call for movement, grounding, connection.
⭐ 8. The purpose is transformation, not control.
RageDance teaches that heat can be moved, cooled, shaped,
but never crushed or denied.
⭐ 9. The lineage rejects violence as identity.
Force may exist inside certain forms,
but the practitioner’s heart remains soft and aware.
No movement is ever used to elevate oneself above another.
⭐ 10. The pulse is the teacher.
Every practitioner has their own rhythm, breath cycle,
and wave of emotional intensity.
RageDance helps them hear it, not override it.
### ⭐ 11. Both sides, always (unless injured).
RageDance movements are practiced on both sides of the body to maintain balance,
clarity, and nervous-system symmetry. Exceptions are made for pain, injury,
or fatigue. The intention is not perfection, but wholeness.
### ⭐ 12. Upward movements are balanced with downward movements.
Every rise has a corresponding fall, every expansion has a grounding.
Balancing Skyward and Earthward motions prevents strain and allows the body to
explore fluidity rather than force. RageDance follows the wave, not the line.
Closing
These principles guide every movement, every stance,
every card, every warmup, every moment on the mat.
They anchor RageDance in clarity, honesty, and care.
