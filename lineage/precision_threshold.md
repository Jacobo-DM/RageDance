# Precision Threshold Rule  
*The Core Ethic of RageDance*

RageDance prioritizes **precision over intensity**.

This is not a safety disclaimer.
It is an awareness practice.

---

## The Threshold
The moment to pause is when precision degrades.

Common signals include:
- loss of balance
- unclear footing
- sloppy or unfelt arcs
- stepping off the mat unintentionally
- movement continuing after attention has gone elsewhere

When this happens:
pause → breathe → recalibrate → re-enter.

Stopping is part of the practice.

## Why Precision Matters
Precision is not about correctness.
It is about *clarity*.

Clarity allows:
- responsiveness
- play
- spontaneity
- safety without rigidity

Intensity without precision leads to injury, habit, or dissociation.

RageDance chooses clarity.

## Learning the Threshold
Beginners may not feel the threshold immediately.
This is normal.

Teachers and guides help by:
- naming moments to pause
- modeling recalibration
- rewarding stopping, not pushing through

With practice, the body learns the threshold instinctively.

---

## Precision ≠ Control
Precision does not mean control.

It means:
- sensing when something is alive
- sensing when it has gone dull
- trusting the pause

The pause restores pulse.

## Lineage Note
Animals do this.
Children do this.
Experienced movers do this.

RageDance makes the threshold visible
so it can be learned rather than ignored.

---

## Final Note
If you never stop,
you are no longer listening.

If you stop too often,
you may be afraid.

Precision lives between.
