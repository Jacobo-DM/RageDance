# Full Moon Arc  
*A RageDance Circuit*

## What This Is
The **Full Moon Arc** is a RageDance **circuit**, not a kata.

It has a recognizable spine, but it is never executed the same way twice.  
Completion matters more than correctness.  
Sensing matters more than shape.

The Arc is orbital, tidal, and whole-body — not symmetrical, not contained.

---

## Core Ethic
**Precision before intensity.**

If balance degrades, footing blurs, or arcs lose clarity:
pause → breathe → recalibrate → re-enter.

Stopping is part of the circuit.

---

## Entry: Awareness Stance
Begin in a relaxed guard or awareness stance.

- Feet grounded, knees soft  
- Hands up in a protective, receptive position  
- Spine neutral, breath present  

This is not a fighting stance — it is a *listening stance*.

---

## The Arc
From awareness stance:

- One leg extends slightly to stabilize the body  
- The whole body rotates in an arc  
- The **elbow traces the circle** — not the hand  
- The torso, spine, and breath follow the elbow  

The arc is continuous and adjustable.

---

## Knee Controls the Arc
The **knee controls height and depth**:

- **Low arc** → deep spinal stretch, lower-back opening  
- **Mid arc** → fluid whole-body rotation  
- **High arc** → expansive, potentially defensive posture  

Nothing is forced.  
Range emerges through repetition, not effort.

---

## Sensing the Field
As the arc repeats:

- Sense the space the circle creates  
- Sense the pull of gravity and return  
- Sense breath, lungs, spine, and balance together  

In group settings, practitioners may begin to sense the pulses of others.
This is awareness, not contact.

---

## Completion
The circuit completes when:

- Breath and balance naturally return to center  
- The body signals closure (stillness, exhale, pause)  

Exit by returning to awareness stance or by standing quietly.

---

## Fool Moon Note (Important)
At times, the Full Moon Arc becomes **Fool Moon**:

- Strange angles  
- Playful exaggeration  
- Odd rhythms  
- Laughter  

This is not failure.  
This is permission.

Play keeps the circuit alive and prevents dogma.

---

## Teaching Notes
- Beginners should keep arcs small and slow  
- Teachers watch for loss of precision before students feel it  
- The Arc may appear defensive, expressive, or meditative — all are valid  

This circuit often produces a strong sense of *remembered movement*.

That response is normal.

---

## Lineage Note
The Full Moon Arc reflects movement patterns humans likely used long before
formalized exercise or dance systems.

It is not a reconstruction.  
It is a remembering.
