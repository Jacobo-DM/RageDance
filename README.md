  <h2>RageDance Lineage</h2>
  <p><strong>RageDance is a practice of movement and presence developed in lived contexts of stress, danger, and healing. It belongs to no single tradition and replaces none.</strong></p>

  <p>It emerges from:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Street reality:</strong> environments where threat, unpredictability, and compression shape behavior.</li>
    <li><strong>Somatic wisdom:</strong> breath, fascia, rhythm, and pulse-wave recognition.</li>
    <li><strong>Embodied ethics:</strong> choosing not to harm when harm is possible.</li>
    <li><strong>Communal repair:</strong> returning to the circle after rupture.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>RageDance rejects domination, spectacle, intimidation, and posturing.<br>
  <strong>The purpose of RageDance is not to win — it is to stay human.</strong></p>

  <p>Any practitioner or teacher who uses RageDance to look powerful, impress, or elevate themselves above others breaks the lineage.</p>
