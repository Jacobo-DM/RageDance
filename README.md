# RageDance

RageDance is a movement practice for unwinding rage into regulation, play, and non-threatening presence.

It is ecological, non-competitive, and grounded in lived field experience.

## A note on use

RageDance rejects domination, spectacle, intimidation, and posturing.

It is not designed to make anyone look powerful.
It is designed to help people **stay human** under pressure.
