# River Wrist Flow
*Gentle wrist and finger warmup*

This warmup replaces tight, forced wrist circles with a more expansive,
water-like motion. The emphasis is on relaxation, pulse, and curiosity.

## Starting Position
- Stand or sit comfortably.
- Let the shoulders and jaw soften.
- Interlock the fingers of both hands loosely in front of you.

## Right hand leads
1. Let the **left hand relax completely**. Think of it as a small piece of wood
   floating on a river.
2. The **right hand is the river**: it gently guides the interlocked hands
   through small, smooth motions.
3. Move as water would move:
   - no forcing  
   - no sharp turns  
   - no sudden torque  
4. Explore different directions and tiny arcs, always keeping the motion soft
   and fluid.
5. If you feel strain in the wrist or fingers, **slow down and soften** until
   the movement feels like a joyful ride for the relaxed hand.

## Left hand leads
1. Switch: now let the **right hand relax completely**.
2. The **left hand becomes the river**, guiding the same kind of gentle,
   exploratory motion.
3. Keep the same qualities:
   - fluid  
   - curious  
   - unforced  
4. Notice any differences between sides without judgment.

## Practice Notes
- There is **no rule but flow here**. The goal is warmth and ease, not a
  perfect shape.
- This warmup can be done before RageDance practice or anytime the hands feel
  tight from writing, typing, or gripping.
- As with all RageDance forms, both sides are practiced unless there is pain,
  injury, or need for rest.
