# Cold-Night Breath Games  
*RageDance Warm-Up & Regulation Play*

These are **games**, not requirements.  
They are especially suited for cold weather, night practice, and outdoor RageDance.

They train breath, attention, and nervous-system regulation through play.

## Game 1: Invisible Steam

### When
After the body is warm:
- heart rate up
- breath present
- skin flushed

### How
1. Stop moving.
2. Stand or settle where you are.
3. Exhale as **slowly and evenly as possible**.
4. The game is to release the breath **without visible steam**.

### Notes
- No strain.
- No breath holding.
- If steam appears, smile and keep going.

### What This Trains
- Breath control without force
- Awareness of environment
- Precision under calm
- Parasympathetic access without collapse

Stopping is part of RageDance.

## Game 2: Breath Cloud Spiral

### How
1. Exhale steadily through the mouth until a **visible breath cloud** forms.
2. Gently sway **into and out of your own breath**.
3. Allow the body to spiral through the cloud:
   - side to side
   - forward and back
   - small rotations

The breath becomes a partner.

### Variations
- **Eyes closed** to amplify touch sensation  
- **Slow spirals** or playful bobbing  
- **Hands sensing the air** without chasing the breath  

Optional silence deepens the game.

## Sensory Reduction Note
Reducing one sense often amplifies another.

- Closing the eyes amplifies breath and balance.
- Reducing sound amplifies internal rhythm.

Nothing is removed permanently.
This is exploration, not deprivation.

---

## Safety & Ethics
- No breath forcing.
- No competitive goals.
- Dizziness = stop immediately.
- Return to normal breathing at any time.

Teachers should model softness first.

---

## Why This Matters
These games:
- Make cold weather an ally
- Build trust in breath without instruction overload
- Prepare the body for deeper RageDance work
- Translate easily into Discovery Mode settings

They are strange enough to be memorable  
and simple enough to be shared.

## Fool Moon Note
If laughter happens, let it.

Breath and joy are close cousins.
