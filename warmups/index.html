<h1>Warmups</h1>

<p>
Warmups in RageDance are exploratory, optional, and responsive.
They prepare the body for listening rather than performance.

<h2>Listening-Based Warmups (Optional)</h2>

<p>
Some dancers find it supportive to begin with movements that emphasize
orientation, warmth, and internal feedback rather than range or intensity.
These are invitations, not requirements.
</p>

<p>
<b>Wobble.</b><br>
In RageDance, wobble is not treated as instability or error.
It is the body’s way of re-finding balance and re-orienting in space.
Small, playful wobbling of the wrists, knees, hips, or shoulders can help
the nervous system settle and listen.
</p>

<p>
<b>Wrist Wobble / Wrist Circles.</b><br>
Gentle wrist circles may be explored in the air—slow or fast, clockwise
or counter-clockwise, in front of the body, to the sides, or behind.
Some dancers notice changes in breath, heart rate, or warmth as the wrists
begin to loosen. There is no preferred tempo.
</p>

<p>
<b>Waist and Back-Body Exploration.</b><br>
After warming, some dancers naturally place their hands on the waist or
lower back and explore small circular or infinity-like movements.
Using the thumbs to explore the muscles along the spine or back body may
help bring attention to areas around the organs rather than naming anatomy.
This exploration can happen upright or on the floor.
</p>

<p>
<b>Waterfall Arc.</b><br>
With arms extended, some dancers enjoy making very small circles while
lifting the arms and allowing them to fall slowly in a wide arc.
This movement may open the lungs, chest, and neck.
Small circles are often sufficient.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lowering Toward the Ground.</b><br>
Some dancers gradually lower closer to the ground using a wave-like motion,
allowing the hips, knees, and ankles to participate.
Balancing on the ball or ridge of the foot may feel wobbly at first.
When rising, moving slowly and letting the feet lead can help protect
the knees. Stop at the first sign of strain.
</p>

<p>
These warmups are not prerequisites and may be skipped entirely.
RageDance begins wherever the body is today.
