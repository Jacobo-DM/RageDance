      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        RageDance is a movement practice for working with strong emotion, stress, and stored tension
        through pulse-guided, non-aggressive forms. It draws from martial movement, dance, and
        somatic awareness, but its purpose is not to intimidate or dominate. The aim is to
        <strong>reclaim presence</strong> in the body while keeping others safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is a working notebook: an evolving record of forms, ethics, and simple practices
        that anyone can adapt. You are always invited to listen to your own body first.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="lineage">
      <h2>Lineage Movements</h2>
      <p class="note">
        These are foundational forms – the roots of RageDance. They are offered as starting points,
        not commandments. Each movement can be practiced slowly, with breath, and adapted to different bodies.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="lineage/skyward_arc.md">Skyward Arc</a> –
          a rising, breath-guided arc that opens the right side of the body and declares presence without threat.
        </li>
        <!-- Future lineage movements can be added here -->
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="warmups">
      <h2>Warmups</h2>
      <p>
        Warmups prepare joints, breath, and pulse for RageDance practice. They are gentle, repeatable,
        and can be done even in very small spaces. This section will gather simple sequences for shoulders,
        spine, hips, and breath.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        If you arrived here from an older version of the site and a warmups page is missing,
        it may simply not be wired in yet. Content will move here as the archive is organized.
      </p>
      <!-- If you have a separate warmups page later, you can link it here.

    <section id="surfaces">
      <h2>Practice Surfaces: The Jute Grid</h2>
      <p>
        RageDance can be practiced on almost any surface, but a jute mat with clearly woven “cells”
        (for example: a jute carpet laid over foam pads) is especially helpful for learning. The woven
        pattern naturally creates a loose grid.
      </p>
      <h3>Why a grid can help</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>It makes angles, steps, and distances easier to describe and remember.</li>
        <li>It supports safer practice by showing where feet and weight can land.</li>
        <li>It allows shared language: “step from cell 2 to 4, then pivot toward 7.”</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tool, not rule</h3>
      <p class="note">
        The jute grid is a <strong>scaffold, not a cage</strong>. It exists to help you notice where you are,
        not to lock you into perfect geometry. RageDance begins in what you feel, not in what the map says.
        You are always free to step off the lines.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="cards">
      <h2>Practice Cards</h2>
      <p>
        Practice cards are short, portable invitations to move. Each card holds one movement or pulse cue
        that can be used on its own – at home, at a bus stop, on a break, or before sleep.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        This section will eventually link to a small library of printable or digital cards (for example:
        a Skyward Arc card, a simple breathing card, or a “bus stop stance” card). For now, it stands as
        a placeholder for what will grow here.
