  <h1>
    RageDance Declaration
    <span>A commons lineage statement for movement, presence, and integrity.</span>
  </h1>

  <section class="intro">
    <div class="pill">Commons Lineage</div>
    <p class="tagline">
      RageDance is being developed as a commons practice by JH Durbin and many unnamed teachers, students,
      and lineages whose wisdom moves through these pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      This declaration is not a slogan. It is a set of commitments that protect the practice from misuse:
      no domination, no posturing, no worship of pain. Only presence, honesty, and care.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <p>
      RageDance is not a performance, a spectacle, or a method for domination.
      It is a practice of <span class="highlight">presence</span>,
      <span class="highlight">embodiment</span>, and <span class="highlight">agency</span> —
      a way to reclaim what fear, fatigue, and the world have taken from us.
    </p>

    <p>
      RageDance honors the quiet truth that every body carries history:
      injury, survival, memory, instinct, tenderness, anger, and the will to keep going.
      We move not to conquer, but to remember that we are alive.
    </p>

    <p>
      RageDance rejects the culture of “powering through,” of ignoring pain, of posturing, intimidation,
      or performative toughness. Those behaviors do not belong to this lineage. They corrode it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>What We Choose</h2>
    <p>In RageDance, we choose instead:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">Presence</span> over force.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Awareness</span> over bravado.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Curiosity</span> over imitation.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Play</span> over performance.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Integrity</span> over dominance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The body is never the enemy. Anger is never the enemy. Fear is never the enemy.
      All are messengers. RageDance is how we learn to listen without being ruled.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>The Pulse of the Practice</h2>
    <p>The pulse of the practice is simple:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Warm the joints before you ask them for power.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Breathe when you want to hold your breath.</span><br>
        <span class="small-note">
          Because holding your breath is often the first sign of fear, overwhelm, or pushing beyond
          what the body can safely manage. The breath tells the truth before anything else does.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Stop before you break something inside you.</span><br>
        <span class="small-note">
          Because sharp pain, sudden tightness, dizziness, or emotional overload are early warnings,
          not challenges to defeat. Stopping is not weakness; it is how the lineage stays clean.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Move like someone entrusted with a body, not someone trying to escape one.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Claim the form that is truly yours, not the one you think you should imitate.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Who RageDance Is For</h2>
    <p>
      RageDance adapts to seasons, ages, histories, and needs. It has no gender. It has no aesthetic
      requirement. It belongs equally to the fierce, the fragile, the healing, the grieving, the playful,
      and the tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      You do not have to “deserve” this practice. You do not have to be strong, flexible, or unafraid.
      You arrive as you are. The only requirement is honesty.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Ownership and Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      No teacher owns this lineage. It grows in the commons, through the wisdom of communities and the
      lived expertise of those who practice with honesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every contribution — every drill, every warm-up, every story — must:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Protect the vulnerable.</li>
      <li>Honor consent and boundaries.</li>
      <li>Avoid harm and the glorification of harm.</li>
      <li>Refuse to use RageDance to intimidate, humiliate, or elevate self above others.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Why RageDance Exists</h2>
    <p>
      RageDance exists for one reason:
    </p>
    <p class="highlight">
      To help people return to themselves — safely, powerfully, and without shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      We move so we can breathe.  
      We breathe so we can see clearly.  
      We see clearly so we can act with integrity in a world that needs it.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the work.  
      This is the invitation.  
      This is the lineage.
    </p>

    <p class="small-note">
      You are invited to hold this declaration as a living document. If your practice reveals a clause
      that needs to be added to protect people better, you are welcome to propose it to the commons.
