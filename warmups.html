    <p class="tagline">
      This page is a living document. RageDance warm-ups are shared in the spirit of the commons:
      no gatekeepers, no perfection, only practices that help us arrive safely in our bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      These warm-ups do <span class="highlight">not</span> replace medical advice or the wisdom of
      experienced trainers and physical therapists. They are simple, time-tested ways to wake up the
      joints, the breath, and the nervous system using what you already have: your own attention.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card" aria-labelledby="safety-title">
    <h2 id="safety-title">Safety Principles</h2>
    <ul class="safety-list">
      <li><span class="highlight">Sharp pain = stop.</span> Pause immediately. Reassess angle, speed, posture, and range.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Good discomfort = go gently.</span> A mild, stretchy feeling can be fine. Forcing or grinding is not.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">No “powering through.”</span> RageDance is not a punishment practice. We do not prove worth through pain.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Warm-up is part of the practice, not a chore.</span> It is the doorway to safe power and depth.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Breathe.</span> If you find yourself holding your breath, the practice is already too hard. Soften.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      Always adapt movements to your own body, your history of injury, and your current energy level.
      If you are unsure, scale down the intensity and range.
    </p>

  <section class="card" id="shoulder-wrist">
    <h2>1. Shoulder + Wrist Activation (Circle Expansion)</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      To gently lubricate the wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints; wake up stabilizing muscles; and prepare
      safely for elbow strikes or other fast, loaded movements.
    </p>

    <h3>How</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stand tall with feet about hip–shoulder width apart.</li>
      <li>Extend both arms out to the sides at shoulder height (the “scarecrow line”).</li>
      <li>Begin with <span class="highlight">small wrist circles</span>, in both directions, keeping the arms long and soft.</li>
      <li>Add the fingers: spread wide, curl in, play with opening and closing as you circle the wrists.</li>
      <li>Notice how the movement ripples up the forearm into the shoulder.</li>
      <li>Start to draw <span class="highlight">tiny circles</span> with the whole arm, as if the fingertips were tracing coins in the air.</li>
      <li>Slowly make the circles larger, staying relaxed and curious rather than tense.</li>
      <li>Explore directions: forward, backward, slightly in front of you, slightly behind you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why it helps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Gentle circular motion encourages synovial fluid to move through the joints (natural lubrication).</li>
      <li>Small-to-large circles recruit the rotator cuff and other stabilizers before you ask them to handle impact.</li>
      <li>The nervous system learns to trust a range of motion <em>before</em> you add speed or power.</li>
      <li>Within 30–60 seconds, many people feel warmer chest, shoulders, and lungs—an excellent prelude to RageDance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
      If your shoulders are tender, keep the circles small and lower than shoulder height. Consistency is more important than size.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card" id="infinity-loop">
    <h2>2. One-Arm Infinity Loop (Circle Flow)</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      To restore shoulder mobility, reveal tight spots, and train whole-body integration. Slow at first, it can eventually
      become a defensive movement when done with speed and control.
    </p>

    <h3>How</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.</li>
      <li>Place one hand (for example, the left) on your waist or hip for grounding.</li>
      <li>Let the other arm (for example, the right) hang relaxed, then begin to draw a large circle:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Up in front of the body,</li>
        <li>Out to the side,</li>
        <li>Then around and back, completing the loop.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Move slowly enough that you can hear and feel what is happening in the joint: pops, crackles, and shifts.</li>
      <li>If you feel <span class="highlight">sharp pain</span>, stop and make the circle smaller or change the angle.</li>
      <li>As the movement becomes smooth and comfortable, <span class="highlight">reverse the direction</span> of the circle.</li>
      <li>Next layer: allow the feet and hips to join in. Let your weight shift. Let the heel lift. Let the body follow the arm.</li>
      <li>Advanced: gently increase the speed without losing softness or control, noticing how the path of the arm could deflect or redirect a strike.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why it helps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Slow circular loading hydrates fascia and helps “unstick” tissues around the shoulder.</li>
      <li>Adding the feet and hips brings the entire kinetic chain online, from the ground up.</li>
      <li>Reversing direction balances strength and coordination on less-used lines of movement.</li>
      <li>It naturally reveals limitations: where crackles appear, where range disappears, where breath shortens.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
      Treat this as a “listening practice.” You are not trying to force your arm into a bigger circle; you are inviting the body
      to show you what is available today.
    </p>

  <section class="card" id="stop-breath">
    <h2>3. Stop–Breath Reset (Pulse Recalibration)</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      To prevent overwhelm, teach self-interruption, and remind the body that you can always return to neutral—even in the
      middle of intense movement.
    </p>

    <h3>How</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In the middle of a RageDance sequence—even mid-swing—simply <span class="highlight">stop</span>.</li>
      <li>Return to your relaxed stance: feet grounded, knees soft, jaw unclenched.</li>
      <li>Take 1–3 slow breaths, feeling the ribs expand and soften.</li>
      <li>Notice your heart rate, your thoughts, your emotional temperature.</li>
      <li>Only resume movement when your breath feels steady again.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why it helps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Teaches the nervous system that intensity does not have to escalate into fight–flight.</li>
      <li>Reinforces agency: <em>you</em> set the tempo of your practice.</li>
      <li>Builds the habit of checking in instead of pushing through.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
      You can use this reset any time you feel overwhelmed, disconnected, or tempted to “prove” something with your movement.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card" id="play-gate">
    <h2>4. The Play Gate</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      To restore permission to play. To explore your own way of moving instead of copying someone else. To keep RageDance
      honest, alive, and responsive to the day you are actually having.
    </p>

    <h3>How</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Begin by asking: <em>What does my body need today?</em></li>
      <li>Allow yourself to move in ways that might look “wrong” or “silly” from the outside.</li>
      <li>Let your practice drift between moods:
        <ul>
          <li>More dance,</li>
          <li>More martial,</li>
          <li>More mindfulness or quiet presence.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Let it change with seasons, with the group you are in, with the music or the silence.</li>
      <li>Notice any urge to imitate; gently return to your own curiosity instead.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why it helps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Play reduces internal threat and makes learning faster and safer.</li>
      <li>It dissolves perfectionism and performance anxiety—major sources of tension and injury.</li>
      <li>It aligns RageDance with Discovery Mode: exploration over performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
      You can make the Play Gate its own small ritual: one song, one minute, or even one breath where the only rule is that
      you are allowed to be fully yourself.
